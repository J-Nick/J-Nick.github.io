						We're human- all in need of energy, encouragement, esteem, and endurance. Flatlands Coffee combines tradition and innovation to craft taste and flavor that is surprisingly complex, balanced, and naturally sweet. We're quality-driven because we genuinely care about you.<br><br>We started by tasting several hundred coffees and countless roasters each year, since we opened as an extreme multi-roaster coffee shop. This meant we became more familiar than most, with what we think the best coffees, importers, and roasting styles are.<br><br>Now we find those 'tastiest' coffees across several importers and roast to our more Nordic-style preference. Such light roasts preserve the coffees' natural organic acids (making your coffee more vibrant and complex), natural occurring sucrose (making your coffee sweeter), and natural volatile aromatic compounds (causing more unique and distinct flavor).
