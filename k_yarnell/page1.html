				  <p class="normalfont"> <strong>TASTING NOTES:</strong> Chocolate, vanilla wafer, macadamia, peach. <br><br><strong>OUR EXCITEMENT:</strong> Literally the best Brazilian coffee we’ve ever had— no wonder it was recognized at the Carmo Best Cup competition! The flavor is surprisingly different that what we’d expect from Brazil and surprising as a natural processed coffee. It’s enticing with flavor complexity and yet, is comforting and approachable… personally, I could drink this coffee every day.</p>
					<h2 class="title2">Colombia La Union</h2>
					<img src="images/Colombia La Union.jpg"/><!--This image has an inline style that sets width to 300px, height at auto maintains aspect ratio-->
					<p class="normalfont"><strong>TASTING NOTES:</strong> White peach, gingersnap, hazelnut, currant. <br><br><strong>OUR EXCITEMENT:</strong> This was one of our first direct purchases from Red Fox Coffee Merchants that amazed us so much, we’ve quickly come to watch their offerings like a hawk. This coffee has a subtle lace of vibrancy, adding interest within each sip, and is anchored with smooth chocolate and nut-like flavor …like a comforting blanket, swaddling you in the night.</p>
